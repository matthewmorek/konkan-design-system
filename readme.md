# Konkan Design System Tokens

This is a monorepo containing Konkan Design System tokens. It has two goals:

1. Sync tokens generated by Firma Tokens Studio to Supernova platform
2. Store native token libraries for multiple frontend environments, primary SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose.

## Requirements

- Node.js 15+
- Node.js package manager (Yarn, npm, pnpm, etc)

## Syncing tokens to Supernova

1. Follow instructions in [official Supernova guide](https://github.com/Supernova-Studio/cli/blob/main/docs/figma-tokens-sync.md) to get your API key and design system ID.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to grab all required dependencies.
3. Run the following command using obtained key and workspace id.

```sh
$ supernova sync-tokens \
  --apiKey="$SUPERNOVA_API_KEY" \
  --designSystemId="$SUPERNOWA_DS_ID" \
  --tokenDirPath "./design-tokens" \
  --configFilePath "./supernova.settings.staging.json"
```

If you did everything correctly, you should see a message like this in your terminal, and the tokens should be update in Supernova.

```
Tokens synchronized
```
